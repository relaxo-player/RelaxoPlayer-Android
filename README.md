## üí° Project Idea <a id="the-idea"></a>

Loud repeative ads make us feel groggy.

You should be able to leave your TV on 24/7 and walk away refreshed. 

We put ‚åû **ADBLOCK** ‚åù  `INSIDE THE TV` and gave users a way to choose what plays instead of ads, we then added **CONTENT-AWARE TIMERS** to make the evening TV ritual a serene experiece.


## ‚ò†Ô∏è Killer Features <a id="features"></a>

  - **Auto Adblock** switches away from ads
  - **Manual adblock and interventions** just in case
  - **We ü§ú bump you away from all undesirable shows**
  - ‚©á‚©á:‚©á‚©á **Smart timers** jolt you to your next show
  - **InstaMute**  `SWIPE RIGHT` to temporarily mute annoying sounds
  - **Inkblot-out the logo** inks over broadcast logos for total emersion

> [!WARNING]
>
> Endless adfree TV can become addictive


### How It Works
<a id="tech-info"></a>
-  The Adblock works by latching onto the Live broadcast logo continuously
-  Double tap the screen at any time to kill ads instantly
