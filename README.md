## üí° Project Idea <a id="the-idea"></a>

Loud repeative ads make us feel groggy.

You should be able to leave your TV on 24/7 and walk away refreshed. 

We put ‚åû **ADBLOCK** ‚åù  `INSIDE THE TV` and gave users a way to choose what plays instead of ads, we then added **CONTENT-AWARE TIMERS** to make the evening TV ritual a serene experiece.

### What is it?

[Relaxo Player](https://relaxoplayer.com) is an IPTV video player app for Android. It can block TV ads and other annoyances automatically, even while unattended, so you get continuous background noise bliss from any üõë LIVE stream. 

No hardware or setup required. Just install, add your existing M3U Playlist and begin watching your favorite TV channels - now endlessly commercial-free.

### Philosphy

üëâ It's your TV

üëâ Simple, feature-rich, transparent menus

üëâ Automation with no surprises, sane defaults and easy reversal of any action


### How It Works
<a id="tech-info"></a>
-  A video player app for Android & AndroidTV with IPTV channel + guide functionality wrapped around it.
-  Use it as an external player in other IPTV players or add your own M3U playlist (recommended).
-  The Adblock works by latching onto the Live broadcast logo continuously (app is not for recorded TV) 
-  Double tap the screen at any time to kill ads instantly
